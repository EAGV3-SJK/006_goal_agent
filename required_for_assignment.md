Required.

Four code modules with clear separation of concerns: memory.py, perception.py, decision.py, action.py. Plus an agent6.py (or any name) that wires them together in a loop. Plus a schema.py containing the Pydantic models. Plus the MCP server from earlier sessions.
All four target queries must produce correct final answers. The expected answers and iteration counts are documented above. Queries that exceed twice the expected iteration count are not considered passing; tune the prompts and the contracts until convergence is within bounds.
Memory must persist across runs in a file under state/. Query C requires the durable-memory behaviour: run 1 records the fact, run 2 reads it.
The four cognitive layers must each be backed by typed Pydantic contracts on their inputs and outputs. No free-form dict passing between roles. No regex on LLM output.
The LLM gateway V3 must be the substrate for every LLM call. No direct calls to provider SDKs.
The state/ directory must be cleanable between assignment attempts.
Constraints.

Pydantic v2 on every boundary.
uv for Python dependency management and execution. No manual virtualenv activation.
MCP server stdio transport for tool calls. No reimplementing tool dispatch.
No third-party agentic frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI). The architecture and the contracts are the assignment.
Deliverables.

A GitHub repository containing the code, the state/ directory excluded by .gitignore, and a README that documents how to run each of the four queries.
The README must include the actual terminal output of each of the four queries, captured from a clean state on the student's own machine.
A YouTube link demonstrating runs of all four queries end to end.
Perception and Decision Prompt and Validation JSON of PoP
